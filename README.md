### Leveraging Customer Data for Targeted Bank Marketing  

### A Machine Learning Model using Portuguese Bank Customer Data

This was a final project for a graduate school machine learning class at the University of St. Thomas.  Our three member group divided algorithm analysis up between us and these are the algorithms I analyzed with our data set.  Initially, I started with my own EDA/feature selection/encoding but then we decided as a group to have one uniform process for our final comparison.  There are two sets of notebooks for some algorithms, one with our group data prep and one where I experimented with other methods.
